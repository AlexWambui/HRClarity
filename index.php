        <div class="inspiration">
            <p>The project was inspired by the struggle observed when working with a small organization that needed a HR software but the only available solutions were premium versions of very expensive HR software.</p>
            <p>Despite the high pricing, the software didn't really offer an efficient way for employees to get registered into the system. Thus the creation of HRClarity to ease the process of employees being registered into the system and also making it easy to perform HR functions such as approving or rejecting leave requests.</p>
